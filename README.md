# Mars_Web_Scraping
A web-scraping and data analysis project

Background

In this project, the skills in web scraping and data analysis were utilized to extract and analyze data from various online sources. Throughout the learning journey, the ability to identify HTML elements, extract information using automated browsing with Splinter, and parse HTML with Beautiful Soup was developed. These skills enabled the scraping of a wide range of information, including HTML tables and recurring elements such as news articles.

This project provided an opportunity to strengthen core skills in collecting, organizing, and analyzing data. Additionally, the practice of visually communicating insights was emphasized, which is a crucial aspect of data analysis.

Details

This project comprised two main deliverables:
Deliverable 1: Titles and Preview Text Scraped from Mars News Articles

In this task, titles and preview text were scraped from Mars-related news articles. This involved identifying relevant HTML elements, extracting the desired information, and organizing it for analysis.
Deliverable 2: Mars Weather Data Scraped and Analyzed

For the second deliverable, Mars weather data was scraped and analyzed, which was presented in a tabular format. This task required extracting the data from the table, performing analysis as needed, and visualizing the insights gained.
